## Problems and Weakness of Current System

Like any system, this software has its share of issues that can be addressed for improvement. One area that can be enhanced is the user interface, making it more user-friendly and visually appealing. 
Additionally, certain functionalities in the software depend on API calls to external providers, which introduces a partial dependency on the reliability and availability of those APIs. Furthermore, functionalities such as PDF to Doc, PDF to Excel, PDF to PPT, and PDF to audio book conversions may not be entirely reliable and may have limitations.
